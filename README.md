Code implementation for Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization


```
Objects in pictures should so be arranged as by their very position to tell their own story.
           - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832)
```

In this paper we propose a new framework named Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization (CP-CSV) to tackle the challenges in story visualization: generating a sequence of images that emphasizes preserving the global consistency of characters and scenes across different story pictures.


CP-CSV effectively learns to visualize the story by three critical modules: story and context encoder (story and sentence representation learning), figure-ground segmentation (auxiliary task to provide information for preserving character and story consistency), and figure-ground aware generation (image sequence generation by incorporating figure-ground information). Moreover, we propose a metric named Frechet Story Distance (FSD) to evaluate the performance of story visualization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-CSV maintains the details of character information and achieves high consistency among different frames, while FSD better measures the performance of story visualization.

## Datasets

CLEVR with segmentation mask, 13755 sequence of images, generate using [Clevr-for-StoryGAN](https://github.com/theblackcat102/Clevr-for-StoryGAN)

## Pretrained model

weights for pretrained model can be download at [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oy-Npt19hYvrGAB_u5c_XYnuBsoBu34b?usp=sharing)

training images and preprocess data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rDjmMr3iqkBjEoE6g05iGyY1I7pi8FTn/view?usp=sharing)

Model parameters is the default used in this repository

## Setup

### Setup environment

```
    virtualenv -p python3 env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Create a environment file .env with the following line:

```
DATAPATH = "PATH TO pororoSV/"
```

### File placement 

pororoSV should contain SceneDialogues/  ( where gif files reside ) and *.npy files

1. setup image for video dataloader

```
    python preprocess_pororo.py
```

2. Segment results should placed under DATAPATH and rename as img_segment 



3. Change related directory PORORO_PATH, etc


4. Try to run main_pororo.py and good luck


```
python main_pororo.py --cfg ./cfg/consistency.yml
```

You need to change the DATA_DIR found in cfg/consistency.yml


### Tensorboard

```
    tensorboard --logdir output/ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6009
```
